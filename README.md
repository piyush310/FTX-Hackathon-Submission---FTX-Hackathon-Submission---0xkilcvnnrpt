## My Approach:->

* Build For Small Businesses -
    * Local business take on heavy losses due to the ongoing pandemic and people shifting to online sellers for day-to-day products. Online payments are the easy way to transact money for these local vendors.
    * Attaching this problem with a social cause will help boost the economy for the small businesses as well as solve for the cause.
    * Red pill and Blue pill is a concept about a choice between the willingness to learn a potentially unsettling or life-changing truth by taking the red pill or remaining in contented ignorance with the blue pill.
